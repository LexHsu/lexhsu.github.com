"Michael Monteleone (More About Michael)":/about/ is a software developer and designer from New Orleans who occasionally speaks in the third person.

After twelve years of crafting corners of the Web for others and two years after blogs "died ('Wired' Confirms It)":http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/magazine/16-11/st_essay/, he knew it was time to build his own.

He's written "more (More About Michael)":/about/ about himself, but would rather hear from "you (Speaking of dead technology, send me an email!)":mailto:michael@michaelmonteleone.net
